== POST

Here is the function to perform HTTP `POST` calls:

[source, haskell]
----
include::{coreSrc}/chinook/Chinook.fr[tags=postFunction]
----

It basically needs:

- A `String` representing the URI resource A handler function to
- A `Handler` to deal with the `request` and `response` originated in
this invocation.
